					 <h1>REG</h1>
					 <h2><p>
					 Reg is a robot who appears to be a little boy. His actual age, origins, and even name are unknown because he cannot recall anything about his life before his encounter with Riko. He is named after a dog Riko used to have.[1]

                     Having an artificial body, Reg might be the only being completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss. Because of this, he is sometimes referred to as "The Treasure of the Deep."

                     According to Garburune, Reg could be an Interference Unit of one of the lower layers.

				 <h1>Appearance </h1>
				 <h5>
                 Reg has tanned skin and dark hair. He wears a metal helmet with two asymmetrical horns protruding out of the sides and what appears to be a glass lens in the front,which displays the number of Incinerator charges he has left to use. Underneath his helmet is a jagged metal headband of some sort, with bolts on either side keeping it in place on his head. His ears are slightly pointed. Reg's eyes are yellow, and his pupils are catlike, vertical slits. There are two red patches of skin on his cheeks, and four more on either side of his rib cage. His eyebrows are small and gray. Though he is a robot, the only parts of him that appear to be mechanical are his arms and legs, which are bulky compared to the rest of his body. He has nipples, a belly button, and even human genitals.

                 He is usually shirtless, save for the tattered red cape he is wearing when Riko finds him. His washed-out green and purple pants are baggy and stop just below his knees.

                 He later loses an arm and earns a scar on his belly button after his fight with Bondrewd.</h5>

                 <h1>Personality Edit</h1>
				 <h5>
                 Despite being a formidable fighter, Reg is rather shy, naive, and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress. However, when forced into danger or an unpleasant situation, he is shown to be hot-tempered and sharp, compared to Riko's analytic, noncombatant role. Regardless of his skittishness, Reg has made it his sworn duty to protect Riko and doesn't hesitate to put up a fight when she is in harm's way.

                 According to Ozen, the way he speaks and handles his body is similar to Lyza. One of his favorite words to say is "irredeemable," which was a word that Lyza said often.</h5>

				 Spoiler warning: The following section contains spoilers. Read with caution.</h5>

                 <h1>Early Life</h1>
				 <h5>
                 Very little is known of Reg's past, as he remembers nothing before meeting Riko. Reg is found by Riko in the Abode of Fossils at a depth of 100–220 meters after he used his incinerator to save Riko's life.

                 He and Riko presume he is from the bottom of the Abyss, as one of Lyza's sketches depicts a robot-like creature from the pit that heavily resembles him. According to Lyza's notes, she first encountered the creature around the 7th layer. He has at one point before met Ozen the Unmovable[citation needed],as well as supposedly been close to Faputa, though he doesn't remember knowing either of them. As he descends further into the Abyss, Reg's memories come back in little snippets at a time. He eventually recalls that at some point he had journeyed alongside Lyza, though he does not remember any specific details about her.[citaion needed] According to Faputa, Reg's name was Reg even before he met Riko.</h5>
